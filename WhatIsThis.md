Since the fight against Air pollution is in such a nascent age, people everywhere are solving the same problems with different approaches. This is leading to a lot of time lost on our side in the fight.

## Our aim here is to bring together all the people who are fighting air pollution in the same space as you, so that:

1. You do not have to start from scratch and solve the same problems someone else has already solved.
2. If you need some service/product, you know what your options are.
3. The data that you find is not bound by your google skills.

## What we are not!

1. We are not a news site.
2. We do not now and will not ever charge for this. (until Github asks us to maybe.. ðŸ¤”)
3. We do not play favorites, please don't ask us to.
4. Everything here is being done in open. Let us know if you have any concerns. (Create an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/))
